# BrowshTest
**This is for anyone looking to use Browsh, which is an interactive browser that can be used in the terminal!**

**In order for Browsh to be able to run, use the following commands:**
* `sudo apt-get install firefox and sudo docker run --rm -it browsh/browsh`

**Congratulations! Browsh should be up and running!**

**NOTE: If you want a list of the keybinds, look below:**

* `ARROW KEYS`, `PGUP`, `PGDN` Scrolling
* `CTRL+q` Exit app
* `CTRL+l` Focus the URL bar
* `BACKSPACE` Go back in history
* `CTRL+r` Reload page
